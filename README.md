# Getting started

## Global instalation

```shell
npm i --location=global beyond
```

## Install and create beyondJS package

```shell
npx @beyond-js/create-package
```

The final command is interactive, allowing you to select the type of project you wish to create from the following options:

    -   web: Ready to start a web project that can be distributed on the internet or as a mobile application.
        Here you can select between use
        - React
        - Svelte
        - Node
        - Integrate another render engine library.
    -   node: Ready to distribute as a project to run in a node environment.
    -   backend: Node project that makes available interfaces that could be consumed in real-time with web socket from another node project or a client project.
    -   library: Ideal for creating projects intended to be distributed as NPM packages.
    -   web-backend: Generates a web project with a backend distribution.

- **--container**: you can use it if you want to create your project in a new folder
