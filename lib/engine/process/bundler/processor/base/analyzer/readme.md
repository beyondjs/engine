# Processor Analyzer

The objective of the analyzer is to extract information that will later be required by the packager, such as the
dependencies and exports of the source code.

Additionally, it is used by bridges to generate the code required by them.

The analyzer can additionally modify the content of the original file or completely omit the file that is being
processed from the list of source code files.
